# DSA QUEUE SIMULATOR ðŸš˜ðŸš¥
# Author: [Pratistha Thapa]

## Summary:
This code is a simple implementation of a queue data structure using C and SDL3. 
It inclues a simulation of a 4 junction road with 3 lanes on each.


## Features:
### Queue Implementation
-**Vehicle Queue:** Each road (A, B, C, D) has a corresponding vehicle queue. Vehicles are enqueued as they are generated and dequeued when they pass through the junction.
-**Lane Queue:** A priority queue manages the lanes. If a specific lane (like AL2) exceeds 10 waiting vehicles, it is given the highest priority.

### Algorithms Used
-**Queue Operations:** Standard enqueue and dequeue operations for handling vehicles.
-**Priority Lane:** When the vehicle count exceeds 10, it is served first until the count drops below 5, at which point normal 
conditions resume.

## Description
### vehicle generator
 Vehicles are generated by the vehicle_generator file. All the data like entry lane and exit lane  is selected randomly and is stored in the vechicleData file.

## simulator
The simulator is implemented using SDL3. It displays the road network with 4 junctions and traffic light managing the passing and enqueing of the vechicle also ensuring that lanes with excessive traffic were given priority.
